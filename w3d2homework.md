<!--
Q1. Where are we instantiating instances of the Property class?
A1. Console.rb

Q2. Where are we defining the SQL that enables us to save the ruby Property object into the database?
A2. In the save method when we declare sql = INSERT

Q3. In console.rb, which lines modify the database?
A3. Property.new-creating a new instance, property.save-saving it to the database, Property.delete_all

Q4. Why do we not define the id of a Property object at the point we instantiate it (‘new it up’)?
A4. It doesn't have an ID until it exists in the database.

Q5. Where and how do we assign the id (that is generated by the database) to the ruby Property object?
A5. In the save method where we assign the result of executing the prepared statement  to @id

Q6. Why do we put a guard (an if clause) on the @id attribute in the constructor?
A6. To avoid a null result if/when the new object doesn't have an ID

Q7. Why are some of the CRUD actions represented by instance methods, and others by class methods?
A7. Instance methods are only used when we are operating on one instance as opposed to all objects of a class. e.g. Property.find is a class method as it would be redundant to find_by_address on one instance, we would already know it.

Q8. What type of data structure is returned by calls to db.exec_prepared()? In the save method, how do we access the id from the returned data structure?
A8. A hash inside an array. In the save method we go to the array returned, index position 0 and return the value paired with key ['id']

Q9. Why do we use prepared statements when performing database operations?
A9.To protect against SQL injection attacks where someone can enter their own sql.

Extension Questions
Look at the find_by_id and find_by_address methods in the Property class.

Q10. What do they take in as their arguments?
A10. Properties of the class that are stored in the database. find takes in an INT, find_by_address takes in a string.

Q11. What are their return values? -->
<!-- A11. They both return a hash in an array of the object. -->
